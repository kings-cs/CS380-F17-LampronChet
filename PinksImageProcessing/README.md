Hello I'm PIP! It's nice to meet you!
I will handle all of your image processing needs.

I. Basic instructions:
	1. To run the file run the PipGui.java out of the source folder.
	2. Open a file using the Open menu item.
	3. Save a file using the Save menu item or Alt-s. After the file menu is open.
	4. Close a file using the Close menu item, but be careful I treat this as my garbage collector, the FILE WILL BE LOST!
	
II. Image editing:
	Implemented items:
	1. Grayscale image
	
Many more to come soon!

III. Close the program:
	1. Please use the x in the top right of your window to close the program properly. 
	
Bugs:
	About is not implemented yet.
	.gif will only display the first image in the file.
	Key mnemonic for save only works when the file menu is open.
	
	
Supported Filetypes:
.png
.jpg
.jpeg
.gif

When saving, if the filetype is not specified in the filename it will default to the type of png.
